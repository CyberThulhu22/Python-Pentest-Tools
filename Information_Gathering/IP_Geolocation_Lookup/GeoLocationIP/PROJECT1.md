# **Project 1**
## The Scope!

### **Scenario:** 
##### Congrats, your Penetration testing company Red Planet has landed an external assessment for Microsoft! Your point of contact has give you a few IP addresses for you to test. Like with any test you should always verify the scope given to you to make sure there wasn't a mistake.

---

### **Beginner Task:** 
##### Write a script that will have the user input an IP address. The script should output the ownership and geolocation of the IP. The output should be presented in a way that is clean and organized in order to be added to your report.

---

### **Intermediate Task:**  
##### Have the script read multiple IP addresses from a text file and process them all at once.

---

### **Expert Task:**
##### Have the script read from a file containing both single IP addresses and CIDR notation, having it process it both types.

---

##### Here are your IP addresses to check:
- 131.253.12.5
- 131.91.4.55
- 192.224.113.15
- 199.60.28.111

##### For the Expert Task here are two networks in CIDR notation:
- 20.128.0.0/16
- 208.76.44.0/22
