# **Project 3**
## Brute Force!

### **Scenario:** 
##### You are working on an internal penetration test for Red Planet and have found a system that your point of contact labeled as "mission critical" has SSH enabled. Due to other findings on the network you know that the security administrator has weak passwords on lots of critical systems. Knowing this, you believe that you can password spray/brute force your way to victory.
---

### **Beginner Task:** 
##### Write a script that will perform a password spray against the SSH service using a single username and password list. It should output each time a username/password combination is failed, and stop on a successful log in.

---

### **Intermediate Task:**  
##### Give your script the added functionality to spray using a list of usernames and a single password, using lists for both usernames and passwords, as well as a traditional brute force options.

---

### **Expert Task:**
##### Add the option to limit login attempts based on time. Example, run 5 login attempts, wait 60 seconds, run 5 more attempts, wait 60 seconds, repeat.

Project Notes from Python Group:
In order to test this you will need a service running SSH. I suggest setting up something on your local network to test against. Be mindful when setting this up, if you put something internet facing with a weak username/password combination you run the risk at someone on the internet doing the same thing we are and getting popped.

If anyone has an issue building up something to test against I will setup a VPS and share. If you want to setup your own, Digital Ocean has hosts you can setup/rent for $5 a month, and if you've never done something like that before ... it is good experience. Something every pentester should be familiar with.
