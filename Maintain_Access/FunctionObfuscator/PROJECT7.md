# **Project 7**
## The Ol' Switcharoo

### **Scenario:** 
##### You got busted! The regular payload you've been using on Assumed Breaches with Red Planet got popped by your client's EDR solution. You've been down this path before, and you know you can evade signature detection by swapping out all of your variable names.

---

### **Beginner Task:** 
##### Take any of your other Python scripts and use your new script to change all variable names to something different.

---

### **Intermediate Task:**  
##### Add the same thing but also for list names, functions, etc. The more changes you can make the higher chance you have of evasion.

---

### **Expert Task:**
##### Build functionality into your original script to randomize names every time it is ran.
